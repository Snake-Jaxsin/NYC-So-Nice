                <h2>Basketball at the Rucker</h2>
                <p>Rucker Park is a basketball court in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, at 155th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard across the street from the former Polo Grounds site; it is geographically at the base of a large cliff named Coogan's
                    Bluff. Many who played at the park in the Rucker Tournament achieved a level of fame for their abilities, and several have gone on to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p>
                <h2>History of the Park</h2>
                <p> The court is named after Holcombe Rucker, a local teacher and a playground director for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Rucker started a basketball tournament in 1950 in order to help less-fortunate kids stay off
                    the streets and aim for college careers. The players in the Rucker Tournament featured slam dunks, crossover dribbles, and bravado that excited the crowd, a playing style then foreign to the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p>

                <h2>The New York Yankees</h2>
                <p>The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one
                    of two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the New York Mets of the National League. In the 1901 season, the club began play in the AL as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank
                    Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise (which had ceased operations) and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders.The Highlanders were officially renamed the Yankees in 1913.</p>
                <p>The team is owned by Yankee Global Enterprises, an LLC controlled by the family of the late George Steinbrenner, who purchased the team in 1973. Brian Cashman is the team's general manager, and Aaron Boone is the team's field manager.
                    The team's home games were played at the original Yankee Stadium from 1923 to 1973 and from 1976 to 2008. In 1974 and 1975, the Yankees shared Shea Stadium with the Mets, in addition to the New York Jets, and New York Giants. In 2009,
                    they moved into a new ballpark of the same name after the previous facility was closed and demolished. The team is perennially among the leaders in MLB attendance; in 2011, the Yankees had the second-highest attendance.</p>
                <p> As one of the most successful sports clubs in the world, the Yankees have won 18 division titles, 40 AL pennants, and 27 World Series championships, all of which are MLB records.The Yankees have won more titles than any other franchise
                    in the four major North American sports leagues. Forty-four Yankees players and eleven Yankees managers have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Yogi
                    Berra, and Whitey Ford.</p>

                <h2>The Statue of Liberty</h2>
                <p>Though you can’t see her ginormous size 879 sandals from below, if you looked down from above you would see that the Statue of Liberty is actually stepping away from broken chains lying on the ground and all that had kept her prisoner.</p>
                <p>The seven spikes on her crown are for the earth’s seven continents and seven oceans and in one hand, she holds high a torch to light the way, whilst under the other arm she carries a tablet inscribed with the date of America’s Independence
                    Day on it.</p>
                <p>During the late 1800s and first half of the 1900s, many immigrants sailed by ship into New York. They would’ve been feeling tired from the long trip at sea and anxious if they would make it in America, often with little money in their
                    pockets. For most people, the 93 meter statue on Liberty Island, Manhattan was the first thing they saw of the United States, and she told them this new land offered them friendship, hope, opportunity, and freedom! This is why she
                    became a symbol of welcome for the immigrants.</p>
                <h2> How the Statue Was Made</h2>
                <p>Over time, The Statue of Liberty came to represent immigration, but she was actually a gift from France, given to mark the American Revolution and the end of slavery. A French man called Bartholdi made her out of copper and iron, and if
                    you’re wondering who she is, her name is Libertas, the Roman Goddess! </p>
                <p>Although the statue was a gift, the United States needed to pay to have her base made. This proved pretty tricky but in the end, a kind of ‘crowdfunding’ advertising was placed in a newspaper. New Yorkers across all walks of life — factory
                    workers, cleaners, government officials, and even kids, gave whatever they could to pay for the base and soon enough, the base and statue went up in 1886. Pretty awesome, don’t you think?</p>

                <p>New York City is the most densely populated borough of New York City, its economic and administrative center, and its historical birthplace. Locally, Manhattan is often referred to simply as The City. The borough is coextensive with New
                    York County, one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York. The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers; several small adjacent islands; and Marble Hill, a small neighborhood
                    now on the U.S. mainland, physically connected to the Bronx and separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem River. Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded compartments aligned on its long axis: Midtown Manhattan,Lower
                    Manhattan, and Upper Manhattan.</p>
                <p>Manhattan is often described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York
                    City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world and Manhattan is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization: the New York Stock Exchange
                    and NASDAQ.</p>
